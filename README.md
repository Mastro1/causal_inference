# Causal Inference
Causal inference is the process of determining the independent, actual effect of a particular phenomenon that is a component of a larger system. Here the project realized for the course at EPFL.
1. In the first part we received a set of data representing different variables connected with cancer. The final goal was to learn the causal structure of a Bayesian network by performing conditional independence tests throught different algorithms.
2. The goal of this task was to learn the causal structure among 12 technology companies by observing their stock price over a period of time by applying the Black-Scholes model of the market.

Results can be fund in the [final report](https://github.com/Mastro1/causal_inference/blob/main/Report_Final_Project_CI.pdf).
